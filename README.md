# FareShare-Ride-Sharing-System
FareShare is a software engineering project to develop a localized, cross-platform ride-sharing application for the Pakistani market. The system aims to provide a reliable, cost-effective alternative to existing international platforms by focusing on fair pricing for riders and sustainable commission rates for drivers.

This repository contains the deliverables for Milestone 1: the Project Proposal and the initial documentation setup. The system will be developed using the Incremental Development Model and a React Native / Node.js / MongoDB technology stack to support deployment on both Android and iOS.
